This repository is for the anonymous reviewing process of the CVPR 2020 conference, and it should NOT be used for other purposes.

This repository only contains a partial dataset due to space limitations and the requirement of a double-blind review.

In the splits, fields "label_state" and "label_state_admin" mean the labels contributed by citizens and researchers, respectively. Field "label" means the final aggregated label. Positive and negative labels mean if the video clip has smoke emissions or not, respectively. The followings explain the label states:
- -1 : no data, no discord
- 3 : has discord (by 2 volunteers)
- 4 : maybe negative (by 1 volunteer)
- 5 : maybe positive (by 1 volunteer)
- 20 : weak negative (by 3 volunteers)
- 19 : weak positive (by 3 volunteers)
- 16 : strong negative (by 2 volunteers)
- 23 : strong positive (by 2 volunteers)
